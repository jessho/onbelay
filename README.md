Web app to find climbing partners

# Getting Started

OnBelay uses [Frappé](https://github.com/dweldon/frappe) as a base template, so the set-up and commands are the same as those listed in the Frappé documentation.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Start

To start the server:
```sh
$ npm start
```

For convenience while developing, automatic restarts are provided with:
```sh
$ cake start
```

## Test

To run the tests:
```sh
$ cake test
```
